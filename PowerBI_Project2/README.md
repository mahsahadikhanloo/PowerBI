### Introduction

This report provides an analysis of state information over a 12-year period from 2007 to 2018, encompassing millions of miles driven, the number of fatalities and their corresponding calculations, as well as the target. The report aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the data and assist in the identification of areas of concern.

### Description

To facilitate this analysis, a slicer has been implemented to enable the selection of a single state at a time with a click of a button. A card has been added to display the selected state, and a gauge has been included to show the latest figure in 2018 in comparison to the target. The color of the gauge has been formatted using Gradient Format style to indicate the severity of the figure in relation to the target. A map has also been integrated to enable visualization of the selected state, with the color formatting consistent with that of the gauge.

To provide further insights, a KPI has been included to display the fatality rate and the total number of fatalities, along with two cards showing the total number of miles driven and the number of fatalities. Additional pages have been created to provide further information, with "Fatalities" demonstrating the number of fatalities over time, and "Miles Driven" and "Fatality Rate" displaying similar information.
The "Fatalities" page has been formatted to show trends and allow for "drill through" functionality on the states to provide a more detailed breakdown of fatalities for a specific state. The same functionality has been applied to the other pages as well.

A new measure has been created and added to the third page to display the target line alongside the stacked column chart.

Overall, the report provides a user-friendly and interactive dashboard with the ability to click on a state and obtain detailed information about its performance over time. The color formatting has been employed effectively to provide a quick reference for the severity of the data, making it easy to compare across different states.
